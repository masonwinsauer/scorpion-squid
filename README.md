## Tasks:
 - [x] Checkout the repository and switch to the `develop` branch.
 - [x] Commit (with a message) and push something to the develop branch. Don't much care what.
 - [x] Add and check off tasks in this README file.
 - [x] Once you think everything is ready to be part of the final product (or at least an initial iteration of it), merge it to the Master branch.


## Ideas for game:
- I am thinking of making a classic style RPG set in a sci-fi universe.
- I want the main character to be a girl.
- I think the battle system will be turn based, like in the FF games.
